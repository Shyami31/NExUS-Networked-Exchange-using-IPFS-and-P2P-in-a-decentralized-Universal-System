# NExUS: Networked Exchange using IPFS and P2P in a Decentralized, Universal System leveraging Blockchain Technology
CS-6111 Computer Networks Course Project
## Overview

NExUS, or Networked Exchange using IPFS and P2P in a Decentralized, Universal System leveraging Blockchain Technology, addresses the need for a secure, decentralized, and universal networked exchange platform. By combining the strengths of IPFS, P2P networking, and blockchain technology, NExUS enables participants to conduct seamless and secure data exchanges in a trustless and decentralized environment.

## Project Need

In today's interconnected world, the need for secure and efficient data exchange mechanisms is more crucial than ever. Centralized systems often pose security and privacy risks, making them susceptible to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Additionally, traditional data exchange systems may face challenges in scalability and accessibility.

NExUS aims to address these issues by providing a decentralized solution that leverages the following key components:

1. **IPFS Integration:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is integrated into NExUS to overcome the limitations of traditional centralized storage. Instead of storing data directly on the blockchain, NExUS utilizes IPFS for decentralized, scalable, and tamper-resistant data storage. IPFS ensures that exchanged data is accessible, secure, and efficiently retrievable by participants.

2. **P2P Networking:** The project employs peer-to-peer networking using advanced Socket Programming techniques. This ensures that participants can connect directly to each other, forming a distributed network. This approach enhances the decentralization of the system, making it resilient to single points of failure and promoting a trustless exchange environment.

3. **Blockchain Technology:** The use of a permissioned blockchain provides a secure and tamper-proof ledger for recording data exchange transactions. The blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, and integrity of the exchanged data. Each block contains essential details of the exchange, including sender, receiver, and a hash of the exchanged data.

## How NExUS Utilizes IPFS

### 1. IPFS as Decentralized Storage

NExUS relies on IPFS to address the challenge of decentralized storage. Instead of burdening the blockchain with large files, only the hash of the exchanged data is stored on the blockchain. The actual data is stored on the IPFS network, which ensures efficient and secure decentralized storage.

### 2. Retrieving Data from IPFS

When a participant wishes to retrieve exchanged data, the unique hash associated with the data is used to seamlessly retrieve it from the IPFS network. This approach eliminates the need to store large volumes of data directly on the blockchain, contributing to a lightweight and scalable blockchain.

## Pros of NExUS

1. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Utilizes AES encryption for secure data exchange.

2. **Decentralization:**
   - Leverages P2P networking for direct participant connections, reducing reliance on centralized servers.
   - Utilizes IPFS for decentralized and scalable data storage.

3. **Efficient Data Retrieval:**
   - IPFS allows for efficient retrieval of exchanged data using unique hashes.
   - Eliminates the need to store large volumes of data directly on the blockchain, contributing to faster data access.

4. **Scalability:**
   - P2P networking and IPFS contribute to a scalable and lightweight blockchain.
   - Suitable for handling a growing number of participants and data exchanges.

5. **Universal Exchange:**
   - Provides a universal and trustless platform for secure data exchanges, transcending geographical and organizational boundaries.

6. **Transparency and Traceability:**
   - Blockchain ledger ensures transparency and traceability of all data exchange transactions.
   - Each block contains detailed information about the participants, exchanged data, and timestamps.
